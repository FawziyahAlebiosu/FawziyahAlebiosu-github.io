<h1>I'm currently a second year college student who's fascinated with people and several topics in computing. I like asking questions about building technology platforms in the intersection of education and social justice. 
<br><br>

I've gotten the opportunity to explore my fascinations while interning on the technology team at FWD.us, where I worked on <a href = "www.informedimmigrant.com">informedimmigrant.com</a> as well as an internal tool that utilizes Twitter's API.

<br><br>Most of my free time is spent working mainly on <a href = "github.com/fawziyahalebiosu">class projects</a> and learning about android development. The rest of it is spent listening to podcasts, being  on the internet or doing calculus.
<br><br>
If you're interested in a stream of my extremely random thoughts, check me out on <a href = "twitter.com/lmaofawziyah">twitter.</a>
<br><br>
Finally, if you'd like to start a virtual conversation, or set up an in-person one (preferably over donuts), feel free to email me at fawziyah.alebiosu [at] gmail [dot] com.
<br><br>
Cheers,<br>
Fawziyah
