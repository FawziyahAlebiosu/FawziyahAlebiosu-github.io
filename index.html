<p>Hi, I'm currently a second year college student who's fascinated with people and several topics in computing. I like asking questions about building technology platforms in the intersection of education and social justice. 

I've gotten the opportunity to explore my fascinations while interning on the technology team at FWD.us, where I worked on <a href = "https://www.informedimmigrant.com">informedimmigrant.com</a> as well as an internal tool that utilizes Twitter's API.
Most of my free time is spent working mainly on <a href = "https://github.com/FawziyahAlebiosu">class projects</a> and learning about android development. The rest of it is spent listening to podcasts, being  on the internet or doing calculus.
If you're interested in a stream of my extremely random thoughts, check me out on <a href = "https://twitter.com/lmaofawziyah">twitter.</a>
<br>
Finally, if you'd like to start a virtual conversation, or set up an in-person one (preferably over donuts), feel free to email me at fawziyah.alebiosu [at] gmail [dot] com.
<br><br>
Cheers,<br>
Fawziyah
